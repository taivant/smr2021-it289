         <h3 class="subsubheader">Project 1</h3>
         <p>CatMews is my first ever web project! My sister asked me to create an infortmative website for cat owners and cat lovers to check out cat facts and silly cat pictures! We planned to create a website where you can sign up and socialize to other people on the forums. Although, I haven't completed that part yet, the framework is there. She helped me immensely during the design process and testing was done by both me and her. This website is created from scratch with the help of HTML, CSS, JS and PHP. </p>

         <h3 class="subsubheader">Project 2</h3>
         <p>My next project was requested by mom. She asked me to design and develop a wild cat consrvation website. This website was made with PHP, CSS, JS and HTML. WildCattos have wild cat gallery, donation page, wild cat facts. I shared a google doc of the Layout and Wireframes and all the design plan with my mom and she shared all her ideas and recommendations! Testing was done by both of us and the website was ready to be online!</p>
